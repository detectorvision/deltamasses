Placeholder for library (jar) files for distribution
----------------------------------------------------

The distribution files are targeted for the Microsoft Windows
operating system. Deltamasses is currently only distributed for use in
Microsoft Windows environments.

Place library files for distribution in this directory. The 'dist'
build target will check for library files here.

Do NOT check-in you local library files! Personalized library files
should be placed in '../local'.
