Placeholder for local/personalized library (jar) files
------------------------------------------------------

The distribution files are targeted for the Microsoft Windows
operating system. Deltamasses is currently only distributed for use in
Microsoft Windows environments. However, devlopment may be done in
other operating environemnts and therefore operating system sepecific
libraries should be placed in this directory but not added to revision
control.

Place local library files in this directory. The build target
'local' will check for library files here, and use them instead
of the ones found in '../dist'.

Do NOT check-in you local library files! Library files for
distribution should be placed in '../dist'.


swt.jar is needed for non Microsoft environments.
-------------------------------------------------

Currently one file is operating system specific, swt.jar. Download,
from http://www.eclipse.org/swt/, the swt package matching your
operating system and place swt.jar here.
